# This is a small project of mine where I transformed an old PC into a server using Linux.

I decided to turn an old PC into a server to learn more about Linux. I used CasaOS so that I could remotely access my server and I have used it to host Minecraft servers.

I first got the PC and removed a lot of the excess space that I could. To do this I had to remove the power button from the motherboard, where I then had to find a datasheet online for that motherboard to figure out how to plug the button back in correctly. Then I built a case out of wood for it.
